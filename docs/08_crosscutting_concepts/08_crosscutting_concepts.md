# Gitflow Workflow

After careful consideration, our team has decided to implement the Gitflow Workflow for its methodical and efficient approach to software development. This model utilizes three core branch types: 

**main**,develop (**dev**), and feature branches (**feat**).

**Main Branch**: This is the primary branch where the source code reflects the production-ready state.

**Develop Branch**: Often named dev, this branch serves as an integration branch where features are merged and tested before being released.

**Feature Branches**: These branches, typically prefixed with feat, are used for developing new features. Each feature branch is created from the develop branch and is merged back into develop once the feature is complete.
