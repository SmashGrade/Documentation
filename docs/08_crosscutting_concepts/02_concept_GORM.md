# Why We Chose GORM for Our Backend
In the development of our backend's Provider Layer, we selected GORM (Go Object-Relational Mapping library) as our primary tool for database interactions. This decision was based on several key factors that align with our projectâ€™s needs for efficiency, maintainability, and scalability.

## Key Factors Influencing Our Decision:
**Ease of Use:**

GORM is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It provides a developer-friendly API that greatly simplifies the complexities typically associated with direct database interactions. This feature is particularly advantageous for teams with varying levels of expertise in database management.

**Code Efficiency**

GORM helps streamline the process of writing database queries. Its ability to allow for writing clean, effective, and concise code reduces development time and minimizes the potential for errors. This is crucial in environments where rapid development and efficiency are a priority.

**Automated CRUD Operations**

One of GORM's notable strengths is its automation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This automation enhances development speed and ensures consistency and reliability in fundamental database interactions.

**Scalability and Flexibility**

GORM supports a wide range of database engines and is designed with scalability in mind. This flexibility allows our system to adapt to different database requirements without significant rewrites of the codebase, ensuring that our application remains robust and adaptable to changing needs.
