# Routing

## Status - Accepted 🟢

## Context
These two routers were implemented and compared in a test project with each other:
- [https://reactrouter.com/](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [https://tanstack.com/router/v1](https://tanstack.com/router/v1)


## Desicion
Based on the comparison on the page [https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/comparison](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/comparison) we would use the TanStack router. In our opinion, the overview of the route tree is also better than with the “classic” React router.
