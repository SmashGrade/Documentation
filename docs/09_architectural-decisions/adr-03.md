# Routing

## Status - Accepted üü¢

## Context
These two routers were implemented and compared with each other:
- [https://reactrouter.com/](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [https://reactrouter.com/](https://tanstack.com/router/v1)

The branches can be found here:
- React-Router: [https://github.com/SmashGrade/SmashGrade-App/tree/%2312-react-router-dom](https://github.com/SmashGrade/SmashGrade-App/tree/%2312-react-router-dom)
- TanStack-Router: [https://github.com/SmashGrade/SmashGrade-App/tree/%2312-tanstack-routing](https://github.com/SmashGrade/SmashGrade-App/tree/%2312-tanstack-routing)

## Desicion
Based on the comparison on the page [https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/comparison](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/comparison) we would use the TanStack router. In our opinion, the overview of the route tree is also better than with the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù React router

## Consequences
